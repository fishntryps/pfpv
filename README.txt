### the pfpv repository contains scripts used for the comparison of P. falciparum and P. vivax malaria epidemiology in Guyana

### the study uses a whole genome sequencing dataset from 2020-21 (675 P. falciparum + 721 P. vivax fastq files generated via selective amplification from dried blood spots) available at the NCBI Sequence Read Archive under BioProject PRJNA809659

### the study also uses 18,711 de-identified malaria case records from 2019 curated by the Guyana Ministry of Health

### scripts were run either on the Broad Institute's UGER (Univa GridEngine for Research) cluster using the Linux distribution RedHat 7.7 x86_64 or in R (generally R 4.2.2) on a ThinkPad P15v with 32 Gb RAM

### further details on softwares, resource settings, and run times are indicated within each script

### data files used by the scripts are provided in the data directory
